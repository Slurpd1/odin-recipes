# odin-recipes
First project from The Odin Project. A small recipe website demonstrating all of the features that I have learned to implement so far.

Features and functions + What I have learned
(Each number corresponds to a different commit)


1. Basic HTML boilerplate along with the use of simple html elements such as h1


2. Creating a sub-folder inside of the already existing folder to store additional pages of the website. 

Learnt the usage of <a> and how to link to different pages within the directory

Used unordered lists to organize the information for later updates


3. Used image src to display an image from google on my website

Used header and paragraph elements to neatly organize the information

Ingredients and steps section utilize order and unordered lists.
