        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast (4 small or 2 large cut in half lengthwise for thinner pieces)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Campbell’s® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup or 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup or Condensed Unsalted Cream of Chicken Soup</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked instant white rice (for creamier rice, decrease to 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh or frozen broccoli florets (about 6 ounces)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides (to prevent sticking- make sure the skillet and oil are hot before adding the chicken).  Remove the chicken from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Stir the soup, water and paprika in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Stir in the rice and broccoli.  Reduce the heat to low.  Return the chicken to the skillet.  Sprinkle the chicken with additional paprika.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is done and the rice is tender.  Season to taste before serving.</li>
        </ol>
